# Mad Lib

# Write a paragraph with blank words included

madLib = 'This is the first sentence of my NOUN1.  I hope this will be a ADJECTIVE1 mad lib.'

# Replace the blank words

madLib = madLib.replace('NOUN1','apple')

# but replace 'apple' with an input function like this one:

input('Enter a noun: ')

# Try to use the input function and the replace method to do this:
#   - ask the user for an adjective
#   - replace ADJECTIVE1 with the user's input
